        <p>Day 1 Convective outlook<br><br>Midwest and Far west<br>A trough of air will be moving inland from the Canadian cold front allowing for storms to begin firing up east of Colorado and Utah that could produce exceptionally high winds and terrential rainfall in some storms. Storms will begin to fire up around the evening time with some potentially reaching supercell status closer to Kansas and Western portions of Texas.<br><br>Ohio Valley<br>A warm mass of air will collide with this trough of air creating a very unstable atmosphere allowing for strong Multicelled and supercell storms that could produce tornadoes. The evening air will allow for strong storms capable of golf ball sized hail and winds above 40 Knots. This unstable trough will allow for most storms to present themselves in a low precipitation storm mode with some exceptions.<br><br>Southeast<br>A widespread area of humid air will allow for the development of Tornadic storms in Georgia, the carolinas and small parts of Alabama. These storms may be more likely to produce heavy rain and may occasionally drop large hail as they move across at a speed of over 50MPH. These may produce winds upwards of 60MPH and could drop up to 2 inches of rain.<br><br>Mid Atlantic<br>A large air mass will sweep across the eastern states that will likely produce powerful Supercells towards the evening due to this increased humidity. These supercells will present themselves in mixed modes and could drop Baseball sized hail and tornadoes of EF2 or higher closer to Central Maryland and parts of Virginia. This swath of air may produce storms as early as noon before rapidly increasing in power by early evening hours.<br><br>Synopsis<br>A large mass of warm air will move across the Midwest and into the Southeast allowing for the development of Tornadic Supercells towards the evening hours. The trough will further advance to the Mid atlantic where storms will once again reach tornadic status and could allow for baseball sized hail in some storms. Storms closer to the east could produce winds upwards of 60MPH and terrential rainfall.</p>
