        <p>Day 1 Convective outlook<br><br>Northeast and Atlantic seaboard<br>A large trough will be advancing toward the eastern half of the country allowing for the moist air to create multicellular storms capable of pea sized hail and winds exceeding over 30MPH in areas closer to West Virginia and portions of Western Maryland. Forecast models suggest that from central Maryland to Vermont, storms will be unable to produce severe weather.<br></br>Great Plains<br>A greater risk of multicellular storms will be more evident as the trough advances through the Midwest and into the deep south. Storms may evolve into Supercells conducive of tornadoes with EF2 strength or higher. Storms with winds higher than 60MPH is to be expected in this region as the warm moist air produces the unstable atmosphere. Some storms may produce golf ball sized hail and could move along the dry line at a rate of 30MPH.<br><br>Southeast<br>A large trough of air will collide with the dry air from the Midwest creating for an unstable atmopshere conducive of very strong high precipitation Supercells. Storms that include this storm mode will produce EF2 tornadoes or higher and may result in rainwrapped tornadoes. Winds will exceed well over 60MPH in some storms closer to Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama. Storms may be conducive of baseball sized hail as they move along the jet stream at 35MPH or more. Evening storms will give for more warm energy and further amplifying these storm modes to an extreme extent.<br><br>Synopsis<br>A large trough of air will move across the Southeastern region creating an unstable atmosphere conducive of storms reaching winds over 60MPH with the greatest threat being evident in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. States outside this region will be more likely to experience multicelled storms with winds upwards of 45MPH and small hail with the threat of tornado diminishing around the atlantic seaboard.</p>
